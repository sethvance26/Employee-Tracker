## Description
Employee Tracker uses MySql to architect and build a solution for managing a potential company's employees using node, inquirer, and mySQL. In simple terms, this application builds a Content Management System, so that non-developers can view and interact with employee information within the database. This way you can add Employees, Departments, and Roles, view the existing ones in the database, and update roles for employee's as well. We were given no starter code this week, so we coded from scratch!
